Following are my recommendations for the visualization:
1) Better use of space could have been done in the plot by starting y-axis at zero. Also, negative values for number of molecules doesnot make much sense.
2) As the data points are conjested at smaller temperature, different scale in x-axis (eg log) could have made the features at low temperature more clear. It would improve clarity of the plot.
3) Curve fitting over the data points could have made it easier to study the trends of the data.

The good quality of the plot is that it plots each data points with associated error bars that helps us to decide to what extent could we believe the data. The plot is honestly showing how number of molecules changes with temperature.
